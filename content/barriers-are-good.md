Summary: Much hilarity in Vancouver this week due to one of our talk radio hosts.

Vancouver has been trying to slow down traffic and has installed some bright yellow concrete blocks to slow cars down. This resulted in this tweet which as of writing has clocked up 6.8M views:

At least it was painted in bright high visibility paint... <a href="https://twitter.com/HiVisFails">oh wait</a>.
