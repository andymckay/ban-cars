Summary: Percentage of population with driving licenses

Comparing two sources of data, [ICBC Active Drivers](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/icbc/viz/QuickStatistics-ActiveDrivers/ActiveBCDriversLicencesbyRegion) and [Canada Census for BC](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&SearchText=British%20Columbia&DGUIDlist=2021A000259&GENDERlist=1,2,3&STATISTIClist=1&HEADERlist=0).

|Age|Population|Active Drivers|Percentage|
|-|-|-|-|
|0-14 [^1]|


[1^]: ICBC data starts at age 16 because that's when people can get drivers licenses. However statistics Canada age ranges are different, ages 0-14, which means the numbers of below 16 year olds as percentage is unreliable.
