Summary: Some of the Federal Gas Tax is funneled back to the provine

ðŸ’¡ This article is part of a series about [funding of roads in British Columbia](https://beyondcars.ca/funding-of-roads.html).

The Federal Gas Tax fund is a system created by and administered by the Federal Government. There is a federal excise tax on fuel currently at 10c per litre of fuel [^1]. This is separate from HST, GST, PST, and the carbon taxes which are all different taxes and vary depending upon that location. This money all goes into the big government pot of money the Consolidate Revenue Fund [^2].

The Government then allocates some of that money to go into the "Gas Tax Fund" now renamed to the Canada Community Building Fund. The Government doesn't break this down much in it's accounts, but for all fuel sold in Canada, the Government received $5.6 billion in tax revenue in 2023-24 [^3].

The Canada Community Building Fund receives $2.4 billion per year from the Consolidated Revenue Fund [^4]. Of that in 2024-2025, British Columbia will receive $313 million. Disbursements are "allocated on a per-capita basis, with some adjustments".

Since the money incoming to the province is split on a per capita basis, let's do similar with the revenue going to the government. The population of British Columbia is estimated to be 5,698,430 people [^5] out of an estimated population of 41,465,298 in Canada in 2024. 

So we can now say that:

* **In 2023-24 British Columbia contributed $769,302,600** in excise tax on fuel (about $135 per person)
* **In 2024-25 British Columbia will receive $313,000,000** from the Canada Community Building Fund (about $55 per person)
* So about **37% of the money that is spent on excise fuel tax** comes back to the province.

You don't just pay the excise tax on fuel if you drive a car. It's built into the pricing and costs of so many things. Trucks that deliver your groceries to supermarkets, buses that move you around, trains that move grain to the ports and so on. It's something that *we all pay* in society if we use something moved by fossil fuel. It's just that if you drive a car, you'll pay more for it.

One note is that the financial report states that in 2023-2024:

<blockquote>"Energy
taxes fell by $0.1 billion, or 1.0 per cent, reflecting lower motive fuel consumption"
</blockquote>

This might be due to more electric vehicles, less miles driven or more fuel efficient vehicles. Electric vehicles provide a funding problem for governments, something that we'll see when we jump into Translink funding next...
