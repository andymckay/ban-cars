Summary: BC Transportation shows they are really the department "moving cars quickly to the expense of everyone else".

[BC Transportation released this image of upgrades](https://twitter.com/TranBC/status/1640443343342653440) in the [Pitt Meadows area of Harris Road and BC Highway #7](https://www.google.com/maps/place/19032+Doerksen+Dr,+Pitt+Meadows,+BC+V3Y+2K9/@49.2309085,-122.6907274,1021m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m15!1m8!3m7!1s0x5485d448d85413b1:0xf48eefacf5a85602!2sHarris+Rd+%26+Lougheed+Hwy.,+Pitt+Meadows,+BC+V3Y+2J5!3b1!8m2!3d49.2312239!4d-122.6895579!16s%2Fg%2F11hb2wlwhh!3m5!1s0x5485d4381cdbdf95:0x67d1ac945988bda0!8m2!3d49.2267468!4d-122.6936449!16s%2Fg%2F11cshg3624) and asked for feedback. So here's my feedback.

Currently it looks like this:

And here's the proposal (with added arrows):

The speed limit on Highway 7 is 80km/h, so given the lack of automated enforcement of speed limits, we can easily predict that's at least 90km/h to 100km/h.

### Crosswalk of doom

*In the bottom left hand corner*

The crosswalk goes across a slip road, designed to let cars go as fast possible around that corner. It has no lights to stop cars or other traffic calming at all.  It goes to an island with no visible barriers or protections. The other end is a green space with no sidewalk or protection at all.

This crosswalk goes nowhere, offers no protection and is just designed to let drivers speed.

### Barriers to protect car drivers, but no-one else

*In the bottom middle*

People in metal boxes driving fast get protection from each other. But no one else gets any protection at all. Pedestrians, cyclists, everyone else who get injured and killed in ever growing numbers in British Columbia get no protection. Yet again, [what does this barrier placement show you](https://beyondcars.ca/what-barrier-placement-shows-you.html)?

### Bike lane of terror

*In the top middle*

Yep, with cars going by at over 80km/h cyclists get protection with a peice of paint. Car drivers get more protection. I think that's a bike lane anyways, if you look at it on Google Maps and are travelling from east to west, that's all you get - paint.

On the south side there is a multi-user path that travels for a couple of blocks, with a stop for crossing the six lane road.

### Pedestrian infrastructure is car infrastructure

*In the top left*

Want to cross the street, you've got a good long walk as you circle around and then over a bridge and then circle down again. This is classic prioritising the cars over everyone else. So people walking have to go long ways out of their ways to ensure that drivers can get to really fast all the time.

### Safety of people not a priority

In project benefits they state:

<blockquote>Increase safety for drivers by shifting northbound and eastbound left turns to alternate locations with more capacity to reduce the likelihood of incidents at the intersection</blockquote>

The do not state that safety of people outside of cars is a priority.
