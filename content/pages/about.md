Summary: What is this site is about. And no we don't really want to ban cars. Well maybe.

We can't ban cars, that's crazy. I get that and I understand it, cars aren't the worst. They provide many useful functions and are used by many people.

If you want to have a race car that's great too. There's track to race them on where you can enjoy your hobby. You can spend countless hours tinkering on it and washing it and showing it others. That's great. In my past, I've wanted a Ferrari of my own as well.

**However**, our dependence upon carsato the cost of so many other things is the absolute worst.

There's a difference between that and having our cities clogged with cars, an infrastructure that's focused on cars to the exclusion of everything else. We can have less cars and more active transportation. Less cars and a healthier population thanks to more exercise and less air pollution. We can have increased density and have great car less neighbourhoods.

Especially in cities.

And yes, my family owns one car and we use it, but not that much. I prefer to do most of my commuting using buses, bikes or my feet.

I live in British Columbia, Canada so a lot of the content will be relevant to here and trying to advocate for change at all three levels of Government. Each of them has a role to play in the story of getting safer and better communities for the future.

That's what this site is about.
