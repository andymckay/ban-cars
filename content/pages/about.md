Summary: What is this site is about.

In North America we have such a car focused mentality that it's hard to see and understand our world without them. But it's time to move beyond our car driven culture and focus on alternatives to cars.

I don't hate cars, or want to ban cars (admittedly in some places that would be good). Yes, I own and use a car. If you want to have a race car that's great too. There's track to race them on where you can enjoy your hobby. You can spend countless hours tinkering on it and washing it and showing it too others. In my past, I've wanted a fancy Ferrari as well.

**However**, our dependence upon cars at the cost of so many other things is the absolute worst.

Currently our cities clogged with cars. We have an infrastructure that's focused on cars to the exclusion of everything else. We have urban sprawl based on everyone having a car. We have a planet that's burning. We have a population that's unhealthy. We have social isolation. We have respiratory problems and illnesses that exacerbated by cars... and on on.

We can have less cars and more active transportation. We can have less cars and a healthier and happier population. We can have increased density and have great neighbourhoods without cars.

I live in Vancouver British Columbia, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ so a lot of the content will be relevant to here and trying to advocate for change at all three levels of Government - Municipal, Provinical and Federal. Each of them has a role to play in the story of getting safer and better communities for the future.

That's what this site is about.

On every post I try always link to sources, link to legal documents and statistics whereever I can find them. This is important to me because I believe if you are going to advocate for a point of view, that should be based in fact, not opinions or feelings. Unlike advertising and the future that car customers are sold on.

Naturally I get some fantastic push back from people on social media, so I'm going to start posting some of best or funniest here:
