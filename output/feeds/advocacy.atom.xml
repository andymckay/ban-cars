Fortunately this was one of those Reddit moments that gives faith in humanity as people pointed out how terrible that would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most North American cities, Seattle has huge highway going through its centre. If you look at this map ðŸ‘‡ you'll see Highway 90 coming in from the east and Highway 5 running north south through Seattle and almost through downtown. It's huge, &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/heres-why-i-5-is-such-a-mess-in-seattle-area-and-what-keeps-us-moving-at-all/"&gt;congested&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.planetizen.com/news/2021/05/113360-i-5-widening-kicks-downtown-seattle"&gt;keeps getting wider&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/seattle-map.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at a Vancouver map ðŸ‘‡&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/vancouver-map.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only highway is Highway 1 and comes in from the east, heads north and circuits the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you come off Highway #1 at Hastings, you've got a roughly 8km drive to Downtown along normal roads. That's not to say that Vancouver doesn't have major car arteries, #99, #7, #1A are key examples. At 3 lanes wide #99 is as wide as a UK motorway, but it has slow speed limits, traffic lights and intersections - not characteristics of a normal highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go back to 1967 and Vancouver was a city growing fast and approaching 1 million and car ownership was growing. Highway 1 was being built and building a highway to downtown seemed like an obvious thing to do. It would go straight through Chinatown and straight into downtown cutting Vancouver in half, destroying some of the poorest neighbourhoods, altering mountain views and cutting off the waterfront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The city simply looked south of the border and adopted what Americans did, 10 years later. There was no critical thinking, no consultation. You only needed to drive to Seattle to see how freeways choked the life out of neighbourhoods.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public outcry, protests and political pressure from &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-freeway-not-built-1.4428986"&gt;Mike Harcourt&lt;/a&gt; amongst others stopped the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What resulted was the Vancouver we have today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I often refer to it as the most important decision Vancouver ever made from a city building perspective.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Brent Toderian. &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-freeway-not-built-1.4428986"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/vancouver-aerial.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vancouver has the highest density in Canada at 18,837 residents per sq km &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It has liveable downtown, with bike lanes, an open waterfront and accessible beaches and parks. There are many different studies and surveys each year but you'll often see Vancouver as one of the most liveable cities in the world &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Although Vancouver has a long way to go, it's become a model around the world and that's partly due to not building highways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, people are &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/11/highways-destroyed-americas-cities/417789/"&gt;starting to realize&lt;/a&gt; that the terrible decisions by many US Departments of Transport in &lt;a href="https://www.history.com/news/interstate-highway-system-infrastructure-construction-segregation"&gt;destroyed cities&lt;/a&gt;, often at the expense of poor and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/07/984784455/a-brief-history-of-how-racism-shaped-interstate-highways"&gt;minorities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also worth noting that Vancouver rates highly in terms of traffic congestion &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, because way too many people drive their cars. That's why sometimes this drum beat of continual demand for building roads continues and it continually needs to be fought against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toronto is at 16,608 and Manhattan at 28,668 residents per sq km for comparison. &lt;a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/downtown-vancouver-population-density-canada-city-centres-statistics"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;larrhk;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one puts it at 5th in the world. &lt;a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/new-report-ranks-vancouver-as-5th-most-livable-city-in-the-world-1.5962819"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;larrhk;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.tomtom.com/traffic-index/ranking/?country=CA,MX,US"&gt;one rates it the worst in Canada&lt;/a&gt; and 53rd worst in the world. But you'll see cities like Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Montreal, Toronto so on all in the top. Hey building all those highways hasn't helped them either. Seattle comes in at #12.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;larrhk;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

They wanted something different.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A common refrain against bike infrastructure is "We can't do that, we aren't Amsterdam". As &lt;a href="https://mastodon.online/@BrentToderian/109334602532842211"&gt;Brent Toderian has put it several times&lt;/a&gt; the suitable reply is "Amsterdam wasn't always like that either".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is that there's no point in trying to be like Amsterdam because people don't cycle, they drive cars. Or we have hills. Or it rains. Or it we aren't dense enough. Or whatever. There's a lot to unpack in this argument, but let's start with what happened in Amsterdam (and the Netherlands in general).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/amsterdam-before.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/amsterdam-after.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ðŸ‘† Before and after&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1960's car usage was increasing dramatically in the Netherlands, as it was in much of the western world. The city was becoming congested, polluted and most of all dangerous for every, especially children. In 1971 3,300 people were killed by car drivers, over &lt;strong&gt;400 of them were children&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1973 a campaign called "Stop de Kindermood" translated as "Stop the Child Murders" was started by Maartje van Putten &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Parents and children stood up and said, that's enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    The streets no longer belonged to the people who lived there, but to huge traffic flows
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Maartje van Putten&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/amsterdam-protest.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ðŸ‘† Protest in central Amsterdam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1973 was also at the time of the Oil Crisis &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so a fortunate time to complain about cars and focus on cycling as the cost of filling a car quadrupled with petrol. When you have a large number of people protesting, you also get city designers and planners which means you also get ideas and support across the political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took time to change, it wasn't overnight, but at a critical point of Dutch development, they decided not to focus on the car as their primary mode of transport. They decided not to tear down large parts of their city to make space for cars, unlike so many other cities in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward almost 50 years and the result is about 66% of &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; travel in Amsterdam is by bike and only 19% is by car and it's moving towards getting rid of most or all trips in the city centre. It's like they are trying to ban cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch made a choice to be the way they are. It's up to us to make the same choice.&lt;/p&gt;
