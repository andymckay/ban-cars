It's always a factor.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You will often the phrase in the press "Speed wasn't a factor" after a crash. What they are really saying is that the driver was (given available evidence) &lt;strong&gt;not going excessively beyond the speed limit&lt;/strong&gt;. As it turns out &lt;strong&gt;speed is always a factor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that determine if you will survive collision with an object, simplified they are its: &lt;em&gt;mass&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;velocity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;shape&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll leave &lt;em&gt;shape&lt;/em&gt; out of this for the moment, because that's a different subject. Let's focus on the amount of kinetic energy that impacts an object when it's hit by a vehicle. We'll also ignore reaction times from all parties and other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on mass and velocity the amount of kinetic energy is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kinetic energy = 0.5 * mass * velocity&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass has an effect on kinetic energy, but velocity has a much bigger effect, because it's squared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 10kg weight travelling at 1 km/h has 0.38 Joules of kinetic energy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 1kg weight travelling at 10km/h has 3.8 Joules of kinetic energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 0.016kg bullet travelling at 1,296km/h has 1036.8 Joules of kinetic energy &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullets don't weigh much, but they travel really, really, really fast and kill people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or to put it another way, would you rather get hit by a truck travelling 1km/h or a car travelling 100km/h? The car will kill you, the truck might knock you over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what the speed limit is all that matters is how fast that vehicle is moving when it hits you. Survivability rates drop dramatically for a pedestrian hit by a car as speed increases &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At 30km/h your chance of surviving is 90%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At 40km/h your chance of surviving is 60%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At 50km/h your chance of surviving is 10%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between 30km/h and 50km/h is basically the difference between life and death. &lt;strong&gt;Speed is always a factor&lt;/strong&gt; and it will determine if you survive a collision or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the police or press say "speed was not a factor", what they are really saying is that society, traffic engineers and politicians have already decided that convenience of drivers outweighs your chance of surviving a collision.&lt;/p&gt;

That will suck if it happens to involve cars. It's great if it involves transit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Induced demand in other words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/if-you-build-it.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically when you build something and provide more capacity, like roads, bike lanes, trains, subways, people will use them. By building infrastructure you've induced people to start using it, you've induced demand for that thing. Over time, people's habits change, people change their behaviour to use that infrastructure &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with Vancouver you can see this happening as condo towers spring up around Skytrain stations. The Cambie, Oak and Marien (Canada Line), Brentwood (Millenium Line) and so on are seeing huge increases in densities of population because they are on the Skytrain providing quick and cheap access to other parts of Vancouver. People want to live near the station to use the line, so condo towers are going up near the stations and ridership is going up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true with roads, build more roads and more car drivers will use them. People will build new homes and businesses to make use of the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cars are bad at scaling to large numbers of users. Inducing demand leads to congestion again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transit is designed to scale to large numbers of users. Inducing demand leads to better services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody wants their buses to be packed or trains to be full all the time. But when buses don't have enough people on them, they get cut. Transit is designed to scale, cars on roads are not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an Australian TV show which sums it up well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a video from Toronto explaining the difference between induced demand for cars and transit:&lt;/p&gt;

They wanted something different.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A common refrain against bike infrastructure is "We can't do that, we aren't Amsterdam". As &lt;a href="https://mastodon.online/@BrentToderian/109334602532842211"&gt;Brent Toderian has put it several times&lt;/a&gt; the suitable reply is "Amsterdam wasn't always like that either".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is that there's no point in trying to be like Amsterdam because people don't cycle, they drive cars. Or we have hills. Or it rains. Or it we aren't dense enough. Or whatever. There's a lot to unpack in this argument, but let's start with what happened in Amsterdam (and the Netherlands in general).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/amsterdam-before.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/amsterdam-after.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ðŸ‘† Before and after&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1960's car usage was increasing dramatically in the Netherlands, as it was in much of the western world. The city was becoming congested, polluted and most of all dangerous for every, especially children. In 1971 3,300 people were killed by car drivers, over &lt;strong&gt;400 of them were children&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1973 a campaign called "Stop de Kindermood" translated as "Stop the Child Murders" was started by Maartje van Putten &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Parents and children stood up and said, that's enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    The streets no longer belonged to the people who lived there, but to huge traffic flows
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Maartje van Putten&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/amsterdam-protest.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ðŸ‘† Protest in central Amsterdam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1973 was also at the time of the Oil Crisis &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so a fortunate time to complain about cars and focus on cycling as the cost of filling a car quadrupled with petrol. When you have a large number of people protesting, you also get city designers and planners which means you also get ideas and support across the political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took time to change, it wasn't overnight, but at a critical point of Dutch development, they decided not to focus on the car as their primary mode of transport. They decided not to tear down large parts of their city to make space for cars, unlike so many other cities in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward almost 50 years and the result is about 66% of &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; travel in Amsterdam is by bike and only 19% is by car and it's moving towards getting rid of most or all trips in the city centre. It's like they are trying to ban cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch made a choice to be the way they are. It's up to us to make the same choice.&lt;/p&gt;
