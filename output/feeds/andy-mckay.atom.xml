Unsurprisngly lead by Councilors Lisa Muri, Betty Forbes and Mike Little on removing part of the bike lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current news is that the District will spend $200k to remove or alter the bike lane to provide 8 parking spots. So that's $25k per parking spot to allow storage of private property on public land, reducing access for everyone else. This is a reminder that free parking isn't free and is a choice by municipalities for tax payers to subsidise parking &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking that perhaps this project was put in hastily or without public consultation, this project took over 3 years from public engagement to completion &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so it didn't happen overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time the District is looking at deferring or delaying more bike lanes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/dnv-budget-2023.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes delaying the Spirit Trail. The Spirit Trail is meant to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Winding its way along our scenic waterfront, the North Shore Spirit Trail is truly a City treasure as a fully accessible 35km greenway that will extend from Horseshoe Bay to Deep Cove&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;City of North Vancouver, &lt;a href="https://www.cnv.org/Parks-Recreation/Parks-Greenways/greenways/north-shore-spirit-trail"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City of North Vancouver has done a great job on the Spirit trail and should be lauded for the work they've done. The District of North Vancouver has done nothing and it stops at the City boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means there is no safe way to cycle to Deep Cove, one of Vancouvers most popular tourist locations. A spot that every year is overrun by cars. It's the number one complaint and issue in Deep Cove and repeatedly the District asks people to cycle and then &lt;strong&gt;provides no safe way to do it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spirit Trail has been delayed &lt;strong&gt;since its first proposal in 2007&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summary: the District seems to be going all the wrong directions. If you feel none of this makes sense, feel free to &lt;a href="https://www.dnv.org/government-administration/mayor-and-councillors"&gt;contact the councillors&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

But less people can drive than potentially cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For this I wanted to get some solid data on who can actually drive, so I've got some numbers to back up later discussions. From the age of about ~5 to about ~70 for most people can ride a bike or walk for short trips. There's a group there somewhere in the middle who can ride, walk etc for longer distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However driving is gated by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a license&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic factors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If "not everyone can cycle", surely "not everyone can drive"? At Beyond Cars we want people to be able to drive, walk, take the bus or cycle or whatever form of transit they'd like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we compared the numbers from ICBC with Statistics Canada. Spent far too long looking at Tableau and CSV files and putting the data into a &lt;a href="https://github.com/andymckay/beyond-cars-data"&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. The results for British Columbia are for 2021 &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Age range&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Number of drivers licenses&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Population&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Percentage without drivers license&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0-15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;766,895&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16-18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;105,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;152,265&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;31.04%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;164,715&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21.08%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22-25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;215,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;246,915&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12.93%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;26-35&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;665,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;701,700&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5.23%&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;663,070&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.48%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;46-55&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;600,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;643,580&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6.77%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;56-65&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;650,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;713,420&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8.89%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;66-75&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;505,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;564,145&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10.48%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;76-85&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;210,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;280,175&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;25.05%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;86-100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;39,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;103,950&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;62.48%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;All&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3,759,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5,000,830&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24.83%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the outcome is 24.83% of people do not have a drivers license. However that is obviously skewed at either end with those too young to drive, or those past the age of 86 who are likely to old to be able to drive. In the 26-65 age range we have 7% of British Columbians who have no drivers license. At the other ends of the spectrum we can see the numbers shoot up dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many vehicles are there in British Columbia &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passenger vehicles: 2,330,014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commercial vehicles: 508,278&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for every person with a driving license, there's 0.62 passenger vehicles for that person &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's odd but ICBC's data is consistenly rounded to 5k or 10k people 🤷‍♂&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you were wondering, that's an 11% increase in the number of passenger vehicles since 2017, 5 years ago.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional speed camera is one that is at a fixed point and measures cars going past that point. In BC these were called photo radar and had a spotty past. They were introduced and hated, because that's more important that saving peoples lives. David Eby, now our current premier said in 2017:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We're not considering photo radar. It is wildly unpopular among British Columbians. They hate it. We've heard that loud and clear."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;David Eby, &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/despite-unpopularity-bringing-photo-radar-back-to-b-c-a-good-idea-expert-says-1.4222131"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average speed cameras measure the time it takes for a vehicle to get from one location to another. This is perfect for a highway, such as the Sea to Sky highway, which is one of the most dangerous highways in BC, with crashes regularly. The Sea to Sky is the road from Vancouver to Squamish and Whistler. It's always been plagued by speeders, from those rushing up and down from Whistler to catch skiing, to just the people commuting from Squamish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it has very few entrances and exits that people use. Horseshoe Bay to Lions Bay, Lions Bay to Squamish and then Squamish to Whistler would be 3 ideal spots to place speed cameras. That's a total of 6 sets of cameras and can ticket people who travel faster than the (sometimes variable) speed limit in that area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do average speed cameras work? Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study in the UK:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...the number of fatal and serious collisions decreases by 36% after average speed cameras are introduced."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RAC Foundation, &lt;a href="https://www.racfoundation.org/research/safety/effectiveness-average-speed-cameras-great-britain"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland Minister:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When we had them on the A77 [highway] back in 2005, fatal and serious casualties dropped by 74 per cent within a really short period of time"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;CBC, &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/how-average-speed-cameras-could-make-b-c-s-roads-safer-1.4520261"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lions Bay mayor is asking for them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In a presentation that was also given to provincial officials the Mayor states that the MOTI reports that 85% of motorists are traveling between 85-110 km/h through the 60 km/h zone that runs through the community"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mountain FM, &lt;a href="https://www.mountainfm.com/2017/11/02/lions-bay-mayor-advocating-average-speed-distance-corridors/"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average speed cameras work and have many other advantages, they reduce enforcement costs, reduce insurance premiums and so on which I'll get into other posts. But put simply, they stop people speeding. Speeding is one of the biggest contributor of crashes in BC and also increases the &lt;a href="https://beyondcars.ca/speed-is-always-a-factor.html"&gt;chances of fatalities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crash data from ICBC in 2021 &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Contributing factors in fatal crashes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed: 27%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impairment: 23%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distraction: 28%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020 distracted driving overtook speeding as the main contributing factor according to &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/icbc/viz/QuickStatistics-Contributingfactors/Contributingfactors"&gt;ICBC&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Fortunately this was one of those Reddit moments that gives faith in humanity as people pointed out how terrible that would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most North American cities, Seattle has huge highway going through its centre. If you look at this map 👇 you'll see Highway 90 coming in from the east and Highway 5 running north south through Seattle and almost through downtown. It's huge, &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/heres-why-i-5-is-such-a-mess-in-seattle-area-and-what-keeps-us-moving-at-all/"&gt;congested&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.planetizen.com/news/2021/05/113360-i-5-widening-kicks-downtown-seattle"&gt;keeps getting wider&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/seattle-map.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at a Vancouver map 👇&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/vancouver-map.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only highway is Highway 1 and comes in from the east, heads north and circuits the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you come off Highway #1 at Hastings, you've got a roughly 8km drive to Downtown along normal roads. That's not to say that Vancouver doesn't have major car arteries, #99, #7, #1A are key examples. At 3 lanes wide #99 is as wide as a UK motorway, but it has slow speed limits, traffic lights and intersections - not characteristics of a normal highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go back to 1967 and Vancouver was a city growing fast and approaching 1 million and car ownership was growing. Highway 1 was being built and building a highway to downtown seemed like an obvious thing to do. It would go straight through Chinatown and straight into downtown cutting Vancouver in half, destroying some of the poorest neighbourhoods, altering mountain views and cutting off the waterfront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The city simply looked south of the border and adopted what Americans did, 10 years later. There was no critical thinking, no consultation. You only needed to drive to Seattle to see how freeways choked the life out of neighbourhoods.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dr V Setty Pendakur. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/09/story-cities-38-vancouver-canada-freeway-protest-liveable-city"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public outcry, protests and political pressure from &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-freeway-not-built-1.4428986"&gt;Mike Harcourt&lt;/a&gt; amongst others stopped the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What resulted was the Vancouver we have today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I often refer to it as the most important decision Vancouver ever made from a city building perspective.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Brent Toderian. &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-freeway-not-built-1.4428986"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/vancouver-aerial.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vancouver has the highest density in Canada at 18,837 residents per sq km &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It has a liveable downtown, with parks, bike lanes, an open waterfront and accessible beaches. There are many different studies and surveys each year - but you'll often see Vancouver rated as one of the most liveable cities in the world &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Although Vancouver has a long way to go, it's become a model around the world and that's partly due to not building highways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, people are &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/11/highways-destroyed-americas-cities/417789/"&gt;starting to realize&lt;/a&gt; that the terrible decisions by many US Departments of Transport in &lt;a href="https://www.history.com/news/interstate-highway-system-infrastructure-construction-segregation"&gt;destroyed cities&lt;/a&gt;, often at the expense of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/07/984784455/a-brief-history-of-how-racism-shaped-interstate-highways"&gt;minorities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also worth noting that Vancouver rates highly in terms of traffic congestion &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, because way too many people drive their cars. That's why sometimes this drum beat of continual demand for building roads continues and it continually needs to be fought against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toronto is at 16,608 and Manhattan at 28,668 residents per sq km for comparison. &lt;a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/downtown-vancouver-population-density-canada-city-centres-statistics"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one puts it at 5th in the world. &lt;a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/new-report-ranks-vancouver-as-5th-most-livable-city-in-the-world-1.5962819"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.tomtom.com/traffic-index/ranking/?country=CA,MX,US"&gt;one rates it the worst in Canada&lt;/a&gt; and 53rd worst in the world, 3rd worst in North America. But you'll see cities like Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Montreal, Toronto so on all in the top. Hey building all those highways hasn't helped them either. Seattle comes in at 166th in the world, 12th worst in North America.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's always a factor.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You will often the phrase in the press "Speed wasn't a factor" after a crash. What they are really saying is that the driver was (given available evidence) &lt;strong&gt;not going excessively beyond the speed limit&lt;/strong&gt;. As it turns out &lt;strong&gt;speed is always a factor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that determine if you will survive collision with an object, simplified they are its: &lt;em&gt;mass&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;velocity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;shape&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll leave &lt;em&gt;shape&lt;/em&gt; out of this for the moment, because that's a different subject. Let's focus on the amount of kinetic energy that impacts an object when it's hit by a vehicle. We'll also ignore reaction times from all parties and other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on mass and velocity the amount of kinetic energy is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kinetic energy = 0.5 * mass * velocity&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass has an effect on kinetic energy, but velocity has a much bigger effect, because it's squared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 10kg weight travelling at 1 km/h has 0.38 Joules of kinetic energy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 1kg weight travelling at 10km/h has 3.8 Joules of kinetic energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 0.016kg bullet travelling at 1,296km/h has 1036.8 Joules of kinetic energy &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullets don't weigh much, but they travel really, really, really fast and kill people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or to put it another way, would you rather get hit by a truck travelling 1km/h or a car travelling 100km/h? The car will kill you, the truck might knock you over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what the speed limit is all that matters is how fast that vehicle is moving when it hits you. Survivability rates drop dramatically for a pedestrian hit by a car as speed increases &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At 30km/h your chance of surviving is 90%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At 40km/h your chance of surviving is 60%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At 50km/h your chance of surviving is 10%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between 30km/h and 50km/h is basically the difference between life and death. &lt;strong&gt;Speed is always a factor&lt;/strong&gt; and it will determine if you survive a collision or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the police or press say "speed was not a factor", what they are really saying is that society, traffic engineers and politicians have already decided that convenience of drivers outweighs your chance of surviving a collision.&lt;/p&gt;

That will suck if it happens to involve cars. It's great if it involves transit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Induced demand in other words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/if-you-build-it.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically when you build something and provide more capacity, like roads, bike lanes, trains, subways, people will use them. By building infrastructure you've induced people to start using it, you've induced demand for that thing. Over time, people's habits change, people change their behaviour to use that infrastructure &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with Vancouver you can see this happening as condo towers spring up around Skytrain stations. The Cambie, Oak and Marien (Canada Line), Brentwood (Millenium Line) and so on are seeing huge increases in densities of population because they are on the Skytrain providing quick and cheap access to other parts of Vancouver. People want to live near the station to use the line, so condo towers are going up near the stations and ridership is going up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true with roads, build more roads and more car drivers will use them. People will build new homes and businesses to make use of the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cars are bad at scaling to large numbers of users. Inducing demand leads to congestion again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transit is designed to scale to large numbers of users. Inducing demand leads to better services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody wants their buses to be packed or trains to be full all the time. But when buses don't have enough people on them, they get cut. Transit is designed to scale, cars on roads are not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an Australian TV show which sums it up well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a video from Toronto explaining the difference between induced demand for cars and transit:&lt;/p&gt;

They wanted something different.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A common refrain against bike infrastructure is "We can't do that, we aren't Amsterdam". As &lt;a href="https://mastodon.online/@BrentToderian/109334602532842211"&gt;Brent Toderian has put it several times&lt;/a&gt; the suitable reply is "Amsterdam wasn't always like that either".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is that there's no point in trying to be like Amsterdam because people don't cycle, they drive cars. Or we have hills. Or it rains. Or it we aren't dense enough. Or whatever. There's a lot to unpack in this argument, but let's start with what happened in Amsterdam (and the Netherlands in general).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/amsterdam-before.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/amsterdam-after.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👆 Before and after&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1960's car usage was increasing dramatically in the Netherlands, as it was in much of the western world. The city was becoming congested, polluted and most of all dangerous for every, especially children. In 1971 3,300 people were killed by car drivers, over &lt;strong&gt;400 of them were children&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1973 a campaign called "Stop de Kindermood" translated as "Stop the Child Murders" was started by Maartje van Putten &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Parents and children stood up and said, that's enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    The streets no longer belonged to the people who lived there, but to huge traffic flows
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Maartje van Putten&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/amsterdam-protest.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👆 Protest in central Amsterdam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1973 was also at the time of the Oil Crisis &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so a fortunate time to complain about cars and focus on cycling as the cost of filling a car quadrupled with petrol. When you have a large number of people protesting, you also get city designers and planners which means you also get ideas and support across the political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took time to change, it wasn't overnight, but at a critical point of Dutch development, they decided not to focus on the car as their primary mode of transport. They decided not to tear down large parts of their city to make space for cars, unlike so many other cities in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward almost 50 years and the result is about 66% of &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; travel in Amsterdam is by bike and only 19% is by car and it's moving towards getting rid of most or all trips in the city centre. It's like they are trying to ban cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch made a choice to be the way they are. It's up to us to make the same choice.&lt;/p&gt;
