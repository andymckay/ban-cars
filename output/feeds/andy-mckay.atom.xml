This resulted in this tweet which as of writing has clocked up 6.8M views:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CityofVancouver?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CityofVancouver&lt;/a&gt;‚Å© this is second incident I‚Äôve seen caused by these useless ‚Äòslow street‚Äô barricades installed last month. They don‚Äôt slow down traffic; they cause crashes and traffic chaos. &lt;a href="https://t.co/A4xZOwMCGi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/A4xZOwMCGi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jill Bennett (@jillreports) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jillreports/status/1639037832386998272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 23, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The replies were worth it. Because as many people pointed out, it has &lt;em&gt;really slowed down that SUV&lt;/em&gt;. If you can't see that bright yellow concrete barrier and drive into it fast enough to end up like that... something is wrong and we need to slow you down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after it got a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gappleca/status/1639379807401299969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1639379807401299969%7Ctwgr%5Ed335216f092df90fa83fa12672b607c8ec4ceb80%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2Fgappleca2Fstatus2F1639379807401299969widget%3DTweet"&gt;sticker from the great podcast &lt;a href="https://thewaroncars.org/"&gt;The War on Cars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Ferry terminals are placed in interesting locations, based on distance to the destination and being suitable for a harbour. The cost, time, fuel and staff to drive a ferry a longer distance, repeatedly every sailing is prohibitively costly and inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conside Salt Spring Island which has 11,635 residents over 182.7km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and has &lt;b&gt;three ferry terminals&lt;/b&gt; for cars and trucks: Vesuvius, Fulford Harbour and Long Harbour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, the ferry from Crofton to Vesuvius (on the west of the island) would be roughly 5 times as long if it went around to Long Harbour (around the top to the east side) &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/salt-spring-ferries.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prioritization in terminal placement, and the subsequent building of legacy car infrastructure has left us with an unfortunate legacy, it's really hard to take active transportation to the terminals to catch the ferries. Worst of all is trying to get to Tsawwassen ferry terminal which is around a 2 hour bus ride from Vancouver or a really horrible bike ride &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Horseshoe Bay is a congested area, full of cars, dominated by trying to fit one of the busiest ferry terminals onto a mountain side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/horseshoe-bay-ferry-terminal.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently the BC Government subsidised again &lt;a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023MOTI0013-000236"&gt;BC Ferries&lt;/a&gt; and ferries are an important part of our infrastructure, but this is most definitely an infrastructure aimed at cars and trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time I took a train from Germany to Sweden and the train just happily rolled onto the ferry, crossed the sea and rolled off at the other end. All I had to do was fall asleep on the train as it whisked me across land and sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/train-ferry-copenhagen.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As taxpayers we continue to subsidise ferries, which are catered to car drivers, without thinking about ferries that can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transport people, instead of vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide transportation routes to ferry terminals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place terminals near population centers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller ferries, with more people in would be cheaper to run and easier to dock at places like Downtown Victoria or Vancouver. These have been tried in the past as private enterprises and have failed, for a multitude of reasons, the simplest being that cars move so much faster over land than ferries do over sea. But if you move beyond cars moving people around, you can start to find alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good public transit to our ferry terminals would be a good start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although traffic to Long Harbour could possibly move to Fulford, but I'm no expert on the amount of traffic all these ferry routes get.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you can't cycle through Massey tunnel so you have to put your bike on transit, or the free shuttle which runs every hour. Or just cycle along the dangerous and horrendous River Road, Alex Fraser bridge combo. Really it's one of the worst bike rides I've done in the Lower Mainland.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Safety barriers like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;used to stop 'out of control' vehicles from leaving the road and hitting roadside hazards, including slopes&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;IRAP, &lt;a href="https://toolkit.irap.org/safer-road-treatments/roadside-safety-barriers/"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so 'out of control' or 'errant' vehicles are a problem. When you drive the Sea to Sky highway you might be grateful that there's some barriers to protect you from going over the edge, or into a cliff üëá&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/sea-to-sky.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Car drivers make mistakes and the damage caused in those mistakes need mitigating by the addition of barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But look at that image again and you'll notice between the car lanes and barriers is the bike lane. The bike lane is protected with a peice of paint, it doesn't get a barrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pattern you see all over the place. On causeway to the ferry terminal at Tsawwassen üëá&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/ferry-causeway.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the low level road in North Vancouver üëá&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/low-level-road.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The barriers in this case are protecting cars from going into bushes, slopes or onto beaches. This is a clear admission that things can go wrong and is done to protect car drivers from the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the most vulnerable road users are not protected in any manner from the exact same circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The barrier is an admisssion that the car driver is not too be trusted to drive in a safe and careful manner down the road. While simultaneously ignoring the exact same situation for cyclists.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that needs to happen is to move the &lt;em&gt;movable barrier&lt;/em&gt; to the left and provide a seperation between the car lane and bike lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see a barrier placement like this, ask yourself what the politicians and traffic engineers who designed and approved this were thinking of and who they care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all barriers are the same, but the most common is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_barrier"&gt;Jersey barriers&lt;/a&gt;, first used in New Jersey in 1950s and have a &lt;a href="https://highways.dot.gov/public-roads/marchapril-2000/basics-concrete-barriers"&gt;particular geometry&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's the advocacy that is.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Park"&gt;Stanley Park&lt;/a&gt; is a often regarded as a jewel in Vancouver's park system. A huge park next to downtown and accessible from all over Vancouver the 405 hectare public park is a great place for so many activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the COVID lockdown in 2020, people needed to get out, but stay social distanced. There is a seawall that runs around the outside of the park and also a roadway. As we all found during the pandemic, the seawall is not wide enough to allow for social distancing, so the park board took up most of one lane of the road for a bike lane. This gave pedestrians more space, cyclists more space and gave people space to enjoy the park during the lock down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2023 and every few months its still being discussed if this bike lane should be permanent. As park boards come and go, new ideas come up, we keep getting asked if we want a bike lane, we all keep e-mailing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radio talk show hosts and others keeping stoking controversy and spreading misleading facts about the park not being accessible. The drums keep beating for more cars because "access" is equated to having a car at the exclusion of all other access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2023, the Park board has voted to remove all but a few bits of the park to motorists. They are spending another $330,000 of taxpayers money to remove the bike lane (which has cost money to put in as well). They are planning a new version of the bike lane which is two lanes for motorists and another seperated bike lane at between $20 and $50 million &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and will take around 10 years to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocating for a solution like that is just disingenguous. &lt;em&gt;It is an excuse to never build anything, claim it's too expensive, repeatedly defer and then eventually drop the project in the future.&lt;/em&gt; A similar excercise is happening with the &lt;a href="https://beyondcars.ca/how-cycling-is-going-in-the-district-of-north-vancouver.html"&gt;Spirit Trail in North Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a good summary of the bike lane and all the details and how it still allows the park to be accessible, check out &lt;a href="https://lovethelane.ca/"&gt;Love the Lane&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I've learned a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is exhausting to keep advocating for this bike lane. We are continually asked our opinion, continually sending emails and just being ignored. Repeatedly. The park board ignored the 411 of 594 emails supporting a different approach and went with the politically motivated one. This has been going on for over &lt;strong&gt;two years&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever put in a road, it is &lt;strong&gt;almost impossible to get it out&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bike lanes and infrastructure are given a fraction of the funding yet receive a level of planning, inspection, public consultation and so on than any other development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheap and simple options are often ignored in favour of expensive, complicated solutions. See also the &lt;a href="https://beyondcars.ca/how-cycling-is-going-in-the-district-of-north-vancouver.html"&gt;District of North Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; where we are spending $200,000 to create 8 parking spots out of a bike lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can't get people to accept that &lt;strong&gt;a park&lt;/strong&gt; should not have a &lt;strong&gt;two lane&lt;/strong&gt; road going through it, then what hope do we have for the rest of our city? What hope do we have to combat climate change and car culture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some amazing people who are able to give thoughtful and meaningful arguments and keep advocating for the park. People such as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/martynschmoll"&gt;Martyn Schmoll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://mastodon.social/@Lucyincanada@c.im"&gt;Lucy in Canada&lt;/a&gt; just keep going. Thank you to you all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cycling isn't the exhausting thing, advocating for it is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen estimates on Twitter go up to $100 million, which given inflation between now and 10 years time, seems an underestimate.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's a phenomenon to describe how the unconcious biases have favour cars. &lt;a href="https://thewaroncars.org/2023/01/31/car-brain-with-dr-ian-walker/"&gt;This podcast&lt;/a&gt; gives a good dive into the subject and there's a great &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ianwalker/status/1615248166256869376"&gt;Twitter thread from the author&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something we'll probably revisit multiple times in the future. But let's cover what the survey dove into. They asked 2 groups of people some questions, with just one word changed. The first groups was asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"People shouldn't &lt;code&gt;smoke&lt;/code&gt; in highly populated areas where other people have to breathe the &lt;code&gt;cigarette&lt;/code&gt; fumes"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the second group was asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"People shouldn't &lt;code&gt;drive&lt;/code&gt; in highly populated areas where other people have to breathe the &lt;code&gt;car&lt;/code&gt; fumes"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only change in this case was &lt;code&gt;smoke&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;drive&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cigarette&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;cars&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/cigarettes.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;75%&lt;/strong&gt; of people don't want other people smoking in cities and having to inhale those fumes. Yet for cars the situation is complete reversed with only &lt;strong&gt;17%&lt;/strong&gt; of people having a similar feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many questions in the study, but this is one of biggest disparaties. People won't tolerate second hand smoke, but will tolerate it from cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was repeated on questions about alchohol, working, theft and so on. In each case cars were allowed a free pass. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Risk is a natural part of &lt;code&gt;driving&lt;/code&gt;, and anybody &lt;code&gt;driving&lt;/code&gt; has to accept they could be seriously injured."&lt;/em&gt; vs &lt;em&gt;"Risk is a natural part of &lt;code&gt;working&lt;/code&gt;, and anybody &lt;code&gt;working&lt;/code&gt; has to accept they could be seriously injured"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;61%&lt;/strong&gt; of respondents said they agree with that for driving. For working the number drops &lt;strong&gt;31%&lt;/strong&gt;. We have public institutions and laws to prevent workplace accidents and injuries and have successfully reduced injuries over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows that people aren't using the ethical standards universally. We also saw this during the pandemic when people on social media made comments similar to &lt;em&gt;"As many people die from driving as from COVID, but we don't stop people driving"&lt;/em&gt;. Without thinking that we should stop people from dying when they drive, neither is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driving has become socially acceptable as dangerous to us and the plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Growing up surrounded by that environment, people internalise the idea that fast, untrammelled, near-consequence-free motoring is normal and, moreover, people conclude that this must surely be the proper way of things
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The last major update was 27 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a world of climate change, of needing to support alternative transportation and the rise of so many different kinds of travel, like e-bikes and e-scooters. None of these things existed when the Motor Vehicle Act was written or revised and yet it provides rules and governance for transportation in British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many other jurisdictions are moving forwards with progressive ways to address these problems, but provincially nothing is happening. The &lt;a href="https://www.bikehub.ca/get-involved/bc-motor-vehicle-act-improvements"&gt;HUB has been campaigning for this since 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HUB lists some good overall points. But here's some specifics I'd like too see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting the default neighbourhood speed limit to 30 km/h, because &lt;a href="https://beyondcars.ca/speed-is-always-a-factor.html"&gt;speed kills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing for a safe passing distance for cyclists. Something that is the law in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://bccycling.ca/blog/its-time-for-a-safe-passing-law-in-bc"&gt;Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/new-distance-rule-for-motorists-passing-cyclists-now-in-effect-in-edmonton-1.6194694"&gt;Edmonton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and many other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establish a hierarchy of road users that recognises that those who cause the most damage bear the greatest responsibility:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But those in charge of vehicles that can cause the greatest harm in the event of a collision bear the greatest responsibility to take care and reduce the danger they pose to others. This principle applies most strongly to drivers of large goods and passenger vehicles, vans/minibuses, cars/taxis and motorcycles.

&lt;p&gt;As HUB points out, even the name is biased to focusing on motor vehicles and not people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the changes in insurance at ICBC and the lack of action on the MVA, the BC NDP government was elected in 2017 and has only made &lt;em&gt;life worse for everyone outside of car&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time to &lt;a href="https://bikehub.ca/about-us/news/join-the-road-to-reform-protect-all-road-users?ct=t%28EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_23_MVA+REFORM%29&amp;amp;mc_cid=4e67b64f91&amp;amp;mc_eid=8cd31be349"&gt;send an email to your MLA&lt;/a&gt; to ask for reform in the MVA and get this onto the parliamentary agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most states in the US have 3 feet minimum passing distance. Some less or none, some more.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Unsurprisngly lead by Councilors Lisa Muri, Betty Forbes and Mike Little on removing part of the bike lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current news is that the District will spend $200k to remove or alter the bike lane to provide 8 parking spots. So that's $25k per parking spot to allow storage of private property on public land, reducing access for everyone else. This is a reminder that free parking isn't free and is a choice by municipalities for tax payers to subsidise parking &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking that perhaps this project was put in hastily or without public consultation, this project took over 3 years from public engagement to completion &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so it didn't happen overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time the District is looking at deferring or delaying more bike lanes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/dnv-budget-2023.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes delaying the Spirit Trail. The Spirit Trail is meant to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Winding its way along our scenic waterfront, the North Shore Spirit Trail is truly a City treasure as a fully accessible 35km greenway that will extend from Horseshoe Bay to Deep Cove&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;City of North Vancouver, &lt;a href="https://www.cnv.org/Parks-Recreation/Parks-Greenways/greenways/north-shore-spirit-trail"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City of North Vancouver has done a great job on the Spirit trail and should be lauded for the work they've done. The District of North Vancouver has done nothing and it stops at the City boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means there is no safe way to cycle to Deep Cove, one of Vancouvers most popular tourist locations. A spot that every year is overrun by cars. It's the number one complaint and issue in Deep Cove and repeatedly the District asks people to cycle and then &lt;strong&gt;provides no safe way to do it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spirit Trail has been delayed &lt;strong&gt;since its first proposal in 2007&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summary: the District seems to be going all the wrong directions. If you feel none of this makes sense, feel free to &lt;a href="https://www.dnv.org/government-administration/mayor-and-councillors"&gt;contact the councillors&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

But less people can drive than potentially cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For this I wanted to get some solid data on who can actually drive, so I've got some numbers to back up later discussions. From the age of about ~5 to about ~70 for most people can ride a bike or walk for short trips. There's a group there somewhere in the middle who can ride, walk etc for longer distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However driving is gated by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a license&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic factors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If "not everyone can cycle", surely "not everyone can drive"? At Beyond Cars we want people to be able to drive, walk, take the bus or cycle or whatever form of transit they'd like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we compared the numbers from ICBC with Statistics Canada. Spent far too long looking at Tableau and CSV files and putting the data into a &lt;a href="https://github.com/andymckay/beyond-cars-data"&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. The results for British Columbia are for 2021 &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Age range&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Number of drivers licenses&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Percentage without drivers license&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0-15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;766,895&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16-18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;105,000&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;164,715&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21.08%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22-25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;215,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;246,915&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12.93%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;26-35&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;665,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;701,700&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;663,070&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.48%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;46-55&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;600,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;643,580&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6.77%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;56-65&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;650,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;713,420&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8.89%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;66-75&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;505,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;564,145&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10.48%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;76-85&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;210,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;280,175&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;25.05%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;86-100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;39,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;103,950&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;62.48%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;All&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3,759,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5,000,830&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24.83%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the outcome is 24.83% of people do not have a drivers license. However that is obviously skewed at either end with those too young to drive, or those past the age of 86 who are likely to old to be able to drive. In the 26-65 age range we have 7% of British Columbians who have no drivers license. At the other ends of the spectrum we can see the numbers shoot up dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many vehicles are there in British Columbia &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passenger vehicles: 2,330,014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commercial vehicles: 508,278&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for every person with a driving license, there's 0.62 passenger vehicles for that person &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's odd but ICBC's data is consistenly rounded to 5k or 10k people ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you were wondering, that's an 11% increase in the number of passenger vehicles since 2017, 5 years ago.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional speed camera is one that is at a fixed point and measures cars going past that point. In BC these were called photo radar and had a spotty past. They were introduced and hated, because that's more important that saving peoples lives. David Eby, now our current premier said in 2017:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We're not considering photo radar. It is wildly unpopular among British Columbians. They hate it. We've heard that loud and clear."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;David Eby, &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/despite-unpopularity-bringing-photo-radar-back-to-b-c-a-good-idea-expert-says-1.4222131"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average speed cameras measure the time it takes for a vehicle to get from one location to another. This is perfect for a highway, such as the Sea to Sky highway, which is one of the most dangerous highways in BC, with crashes regularly. The Sea to Sky is the road from Vancouver to Squamish and Whistler. It's always been plagued by speeders, from those rushing up and down from Whistler to catch skiing, to just the people commuting from Squamish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it has very few entrances and exits that people use. Horseshoe Bay to Lions Bay, Lions Bay to Squamish and then Squamish to Whistler would be 3 ideal spots to place speed cameras. That's a total of 6 sets of cameras and can ticket people who travel faster than the (sometimes variable) speed limit in that area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do average speed cameras work? Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study in the UK:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...the number of fatal and serious collisions decreases by 36% after average speed cameras are introduced."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RAC Foundation, &lt;a href="https://www.racfoundation.org/research/safety/effectiveness-average-speed-cameras-great-britain"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland Minister:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When we had them on the A77 [highway] back in 2005, fatal and serious casualties dropped by 74 per cent within a really short period of time"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;CBC, &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/how-average-speed-cameras-could-make-b-c-s-roads-safer-1.4520261"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lions Bay mayor is asking for them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In a presentation that was also given to provincial officials the Mayor states that the MOTI reports that 85% of motorists are traveling between 85-110 km/h through the 60 km/h zone that runs through the community"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average speed cameras work and have many other advantages, they reduce enforcement costs, reduce insurance premiums and so on which I'll get into other posts. But put simply, they stop people speeding. Speeding is one of the biggest contributor of crashes in BC and also increases the &lt;a href="https://beyondcars.ca/speed-is-always-a-factor.html"&gt;chances of fatalities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crash data from ICBC in 2021 &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Contributing factors in fatal crashes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed: 27%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impairment: 23%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distraction: 28%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020 distracted driving overtook speeding as the main contributing factor according to &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/icbc/viz/QuickStatistics-Contributingfactors/Contributingfactors"&gt;ICBC&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Fortunately this was one of those Reddit moments that gives faith in humanity as people pointed out how terrible that would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most North American cities, Seattle has huge highway going through its centre. If you look at this map üëá you'll see Highway 90 coming in from the east and Highway 5 running north south through Seattle and almost through downtown. It's huge, &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/heres-why-i-5-is-such-a-mess-in-seattle-area-and-what-keeps-us-moving-at-all/"&gt;congested&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.planetizen.com/news/2021/05/113360-i-5-widening-kicks-downtown-seattle"&gt;keeps getting wider&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/seattle-map.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at a Vancouver map üëá&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/vancouver-map.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only highway is Highway 1 and comes in from the east, heads north and circuits the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you come off Highway #1 at Hastings, you've got a roughly 8km drive to Downtown along normal roads. That's not to say that Vancouver doesn't have major car arteries, #99, #7, #1A are key examples. At 3 lanes wide #99 is as wide as a UK motorway, but it has slow speed limits, traffic lights and intersections - not characteristics of a normal highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go back to 1967 and Vancouver was a city growing fast and approaching 1 million and car ownership was growing. Highway 1 was being built and building a highway to downtown seemed like an obvious thing to do. It would go straight through Chinatown and straight into downtown cutting Vancouver in half, destroying some of the poorest neighbourhoods, altering mountain views and cutting off the waterfront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The city simply looked south of the border and adopted what Americans did, 10 years later. There was no critical thinking, no consultation. You only needed to drive to Seattle to see how freeways choked the life out of neighbourhoods.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public outcry, protests and political pressure from &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-freeway-not-built-1.4428986"&gt;Mike Harcourt&lt;/a&gt; amongst others stopped the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What resulted was the Vancouver we have today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I often refer to it as the most important decision Vancouver ever made from a city building perspective.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Brent Toderian. &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-freeway-not-built-1.4428986"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/vancouver-aerial.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vancouver has the highest density in Canada at 18,837 residents per sq km &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It has a liveable downtown, with parks, bike lanes, an open waterfront and accessible beaches. There are many different studies and surveys each year - but you'll often see Vancouver rated as one of the most liveable cities in the world &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Although Vancouver has a long way to go, it's become a model around the world and that's partly due to not building highways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, people are &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/11/highways-destroyed-americas-cities/417789/"&gt;starting to realize&lt;/a&gt; that the terrible decisions by many US Departments of Transport in &lt;a href="https://www.history.com/news/interstate-highway-system-infrastructure-construction-segregation"&gt;destroyed cities&lt;/a&gt;, often at the expense of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/07/984784455/a-brief-history-of-how-racism-shaped-interstate-highways"&gt;minorities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also worth noting that Vancouver rates highly in terms of traffic congestion &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, because way too many people drive their cars. That's why sometimes this drum beat of continual demand for building roads continues and it continually needs to be fought against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toronto is at 16,608 and Manhattan at 28,668 residents per sq km for comparison. &lt;a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/downtown-vancouver-population-density-canada-city-centres-statistics"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one puts it at 5th in the world. &lt;a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/new-report-ranks-vancouver-as-5th-most-livable-city-in-the-world-1.5962819"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.tomtom.com/traffic-index/ranking/?country=CA,MX,US"&gt;one rates it the worst in Canada&lt;/a&gt; and 53rd worst in the world, 3rd worst in North America. But you'll see cities like Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Montreal, Toronto so on all in the top. Hey building all those highways hasn't helped them either. Seattle comes in at 166th in the world, 12th worst in North America.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's always a factor.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You will often the phrase in the press "Speed wasn't a factor" after a crash. What they are really saying is that the driver was (given available evidence) &lt;strong&gt;not going excessively beyond the speed limit&lt;/strong&gt;. As it turns out &lt;strong&gt;speed is always a factor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that determine if you will survive collision with an object, simplified they are its: &lt;em&gt;mass&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;velocity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;shape&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll leave &lt;em&gt;shape&lt;/em&gt; out of this for the moment, because that's a different subject. Let's focus on the amount of kinetic energy that impacts an object when it's hit by a vehicle. We'll also ignore reaction times from all parties and other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on mass and velocity the amount of kinetic energy is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kinetic energy = 0.5 * mass * velocity&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass has an effect on kinetic energy, but velocity has a much bigger effect, because it's squared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 10kg weight travelling at 1 km/h has 0.38 Joules of kinetic energy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 1kg weight travelling at 10km/h has 3.8 Joules of kinetic energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 0.016kg bullet travelling at 1,296km/h has 1036.8 Joules of kinetic energy &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullets don't weigh much, but they travel really, really, really fast and kill people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or to put it another way, would you rather get hit by a truck travelling 1km/h or a car travelling 100km/h? The car will kill you, the truck might knock you over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what the speed limit is all that matters is how fast that vehicle is moving when it hits you. Survivability rates drop dramatically for a pedestrian hit by a car as speed increases &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At 30km/h your chance of surviving is 90%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At 40km/h your chance of surviving is 60%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At 50km/h your chance of surviving is 10%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between 30km/h and 50km/h is basically the difference between life and death. &lt;strong&gt;Speed is always a factor&lt;/strong&gt; and it will determine if you survive a collision or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the police or press say "speed was not a factor", what they are really saying is that society, traffic engineers and politicians have already decided that convenience of drivers outweighs your chance of surviving a collision.&lt;/p&gt;

That will suck if it happens to involve cars. It's great if it involves transit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Induced demand in other words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/if-you-build-it.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically when you build something and provide more capacity, like roads, bike lanes, trains, subways, people will use them. By building infrastructure you've induced people to start using it, you've induced demand for that thing. Over time, people's habits change, people change their behaviour to use that infrastructure &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with Vancouver you can see this happening as condo towers spring up around Skytrain stations. The Cambie, Oak and Marien (Canada Line), Brentwood (Millenium Line) and so on are seeing huge increases in densities of population because they are on the Skytrain providing quick and cheap access to other parts of Vancouver. People want to live near the station to use the line, so condo towers are going up near the stations and ridership is going up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true with roads, build more roads and more car drivers will use them. People will build new homes and businesses to make use of the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cars are bad at scaling to large numbers of users. Inducing demand leads to congestion again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transit is designed to scale to large numbers of users. Inducing demand leads to better services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody wants their buses to be packed or trains to be full all the time. But when buses don't have enough people on them, they get cut. Transit is designed to scale, cars on roads are not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an Australian TV show which sums it up well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a video from Toronto explaining the difference between induced demand for cars and transit:&lt;/p&gt;

They wanted something different.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A common refrain against bike infrastructure is "We can't do that, we aren't Amsterdam". As &lt;a href="https://mastodon.online/@BrentToderian/109334602532842211"&gt;Brent Toderian has put it several times&lt;/a&gt; the suitable reply is "Amsterdam wasn't always like that either".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is that there's no point in trying to be like Amsterdam because people don't cycle, they drive cars. Or we have hills. Or it rains. Or it we aren't dense enough. Or whatever. There's a lot to unpack in this argument, but let's start with what happened in Amsterdam (and the Netherlands in general).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/amsterdam-before.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/amsterdam-after.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üëÜ Before and after&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1960's car usage was increasing dramatically in the Netherlands, as it was in much of the western world. The city was becoming congested, polluted and most of all dangerous for every, especially children. In 1971 3,300 people were killed by car drivers, over &lt;strong&gt;400 of them were children&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1973 a campaign called "Stop de Kindermood" translated as "Stop the Child Murders" was started by Maartje van Putten &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Parents and children stood up and said, that's enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    The streets no longer belonged to the people who lived there, but to huge traffic flows
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Maartje van Putten&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/amsterdam-protest.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üëÜ Protest in central Amsterdam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1973 was also at the time of the Oil Crisis &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so a fortunate time to complain about cars and focus on cycling as the cost of filling a car quadrupled with petrol. When you have a large number of people protesting, you also get city designers and planners which means you also get ideas and support across the political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took time to change, it wasn't overnight, but at a critical point of Dutch development, they decided not to focus on the car as their primary mode of transport. They decided not to tear down large parts of their city to make space for cars, unlike so many other cities in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward almost 50 years and the result is about 66% of &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; travel in Amsterdam is by bike and only 19% is by car and it's moving towards getting rid of most or all trips in the city centre. It's like they are trying to ban cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch made a choice to be the way they are. It's up to us to make the same choice.&lt;/p&gt;
