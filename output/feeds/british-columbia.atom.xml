This is then invariably followed with the assertion that since cyclists don't pay for roads or infrastructure, they shouldn't get safe spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a false statement, drivers in do not pay their share of the cost of the road network either in capital or operating costs. You can probably find numerous studies around the world that show this to be the case, however they tend not to focus on British Columbia and don't get into the details of how it works in British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following series of articles I'll try to dive into a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Translink gas levy (relevant only for people in the lower mainland)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Federal Gas Tax Fund&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Municipal funding of road infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provinicial and Federal Government funding of road infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And anything else you think might be relevant. I'd like to point out I'm not an accountant, or expert on government funding, just someone trying to understand how all this funding works. I'd ðŸ’š any contributions, corrections or help anyone can provide. This blog is completely &lt;a href="https://github.com/andymckay/beyond-cars/"&gt;open source and contributors are more than welcome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any discussion of costs of cars can't be done without talking the externalities that come from car drivers. Externalities are costs that society pays, but the actual car driver does not. Some of the examples these are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Car drivers &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/icbc/viz/QuickStatistics-Fatalcrashesandvictims/FatalVictims"&gt;kill 288 people&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/icbc/viz/QuickStatistics-Injuredvictims/InjuredVictims"&gt;injure 48,851 people&lt;/a&gt; a year (numbers for 2023).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cars contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-67288327"&gt;COPD, asthma and other lung conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's bad for your health, something society has to pay health care costs for ðŸ‘‰ "longer driving time was associated with higher odds for smoking, insufficient physical activity, short sleep, obesity, and worse physical and mental health" &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4049576/"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lauriewinkless/2024/12/18/tires-shed-millions-of-tonnes-of-microplastics-into-the-environment/"&gt;Tyres shed millions of tons of microplastics into the environment&lt;/a&gt; and are &lt;a href="https://canadiangeographic.ca/articles/killer-tire-chemical-threatening-canadian-salmon/"&gt;killing our salmon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2024/05/where-canadas-greenhouse-gas-emissions-come-from-2024-national-greenhouse-gas-inventory.html"&gt;22% of Canada's fossil fuels emissions&lt;/a&gt; is from transportation. Climate change, you might have heard of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of externalities is long, but these are all costs that society bears - not the driver. We'll avoid talking about these in this series of articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, here's the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1dg4h7v/tax_the_cyclists_journalist_gets_owned_by_the/"&gt;Mayor of Quebec City answering a question about if cyclists should pay taxes to cycle in the city&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="British Columbia"></category><category term="Politics"></category><category term="Money"></category></entry><entry><title>Reform the MVA</title><link href="https://beyondcars.ca/reform-the-mva.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-02-11T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-02-11T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Andy McKay</name></author><id>tag:beyondcars.ca,2023-02-11:/reform-the-mva.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Motor Vehicle Act is 66 years old and doesn't reflect our society, it's time to reform it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Motor Vehicle Act of British Columbia is 66 years old at this point. The last major update was 27 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a world of climate change, of needing to support alternative transportation and the rise of so many different kinds of travel, like e-bikes and e-scooters. None of these things existed when the Motor Vehicle Act was written or revised and yet it provides rules and governance for transportation in British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many other jurisdictions are moving forwards with progressive ways to address these problems, but provincially nothing is happening. The &lt;a href="https://www.bikehub.ca/get-involved/bc-motor-vehicle-act-improvements"&gt;HUB has been campaigning for this since 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HUB lists some good overall points. But here's some specifics I'd like too see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting the default neighbourhood speed limit to 30 km/h, because &lt;a href="https://beyondcars.ca/speed-is-always-a-factor.html"&gt;speed kills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing for a safe passing distance for cyclists. Something that is the law in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://bccycling.ca/blog/its-time-for-a-safe-passing-law-in-bc"&gt;Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/new-distance-rule-for-motorists-passing-cyclists-now-in-effect-in-edmonton-1.6194694"&gt;Edmonton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-highway-code-8-changes-you-need-to-know-from-29-january-2022"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/transportation/safely-passing-bicyclists-chart"&gt;many states in the US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and many other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establish a hierarchy of road users that recognises that those who cause the most damage bear the greatest responsibility:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But those in charge of vehicles that can cause the greatest harm in the event of a collision bear the greatest responsibility to take care and reduce the danger they pose to others. This principle applies most strongly to drivers of large goods and passenger vehicles, vans/minibuses, cars/taxis and motorcycles.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As HUB points out, even the name is biased to focusing on motor vehicles and not people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the changes in insurance at ICBC and the lack of action on the MVA, the BC NDP government was elected in 2017 and has only made &lt;em&gt;life worse for everyone outside of car&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time to &lt;a href="https://bikehub.ca/about-us/news/join-the-road-to-reform-protect-all-road-users?ct=t%28EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_23_MVA+REFORM%29&amp;amp;mc_cid=4e67b64f91&amp;amp;mc_eid=8cd31be349"&gt;send an email to your MLA&lt;/a&gt; to ask for reform in the MVA and get this onto the parliamentary agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most states in the US have 3 feet minimum passing distance. Some less or none, some more.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
