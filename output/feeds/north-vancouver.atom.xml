It's a phenomenon to describe how the unconcious biases have favour cars. &lt;a href="https://thewaroncars.org/2023/01/31/car-brain-with-dr-ian-walker/"&gt;This podcast&lt;/a&gt; gives a good dive into the subject and there's a great &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ianwalker/status/1615248166256869376"&gt;Twitter thread from the author&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something we'll probably revisit multiple times in the future. But let's cover what the survey dove into. They asked 2 groups of people some questions, with just one word changed. The first groups was asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"People shouldn't &lt;code&gt;smoke&lt;/code&gt; in highly populated areas where other people have to breathe the &lt;code&gt;cigarette&lt;/code&gt; fumes"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the second group was asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"People shouldn't &lt;code&gt;drive&lt;/code&gt; in highly populated areas where other people have to breathe the &lt;code&gt;car&lt;/code&gt; fumes"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only change in this case was &lt;code&gt;smoke&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;drive&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cigarette&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;cars&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/cigarettes.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;75%&lt;/strong&gt; of people don't want other people smoking in cities and having to inhale those fumes. Yet for cars the situation is complete reversed with only &lt;strong&gt;17%&lt;/strong&gt; of people having a similar feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many questions in the study, but this is one of biggest disparaties. People won't tolerate second hand smoke, but will tolerate it from cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was repeated on questions about alchohol, working, theft and so on. In each case cars were allowed a free pass. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Risk is a natural part of &lt;code&gt;driving&lt;/code&gt;, and anybody &lt;code&gt;driving&lt;/code&gt; has to accept they could be seriously injured."&lt;/em&gt; vs &lt;em&gt;"Risk is a natural part of &lt;code&gt;working&lt;/code&gt;, and anybody &lt;code&gt;working&lt;/code&gt; has to accept they could be seriously injured"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;61%&lt;/strong&gt; of respondents said they agree with that for driving. For working the number drops &lt;strong&gt;31%&lt;/strong&gt;. We have public institutions and laws to prevent workplace accidents and injuries and have successfully reduced injuries over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows that people aren't using the ethical standards universally. We also saw this during the pandemic when people on social media made comments similar to &lt;em&gt;"As many people die from driving as from COVID, but we don't stop people driving"&lt;/em&gt;. Without thinking that we should stop people from dying when they drive, neither is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driving has become socially acceptable as dangerous to us and the plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Growing up surrounded by that environment, people internalise the idea that fast, untrammelled, near-consequence-free motoring is normal and, moreover, people conclude that this must surely be the proper way of things
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thinking of it being normal they call "Motornormativity".&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="North Vancouver"></category><category term="Infrastructure"></category><category term="Politics"></category><category term="Parking"></category><category term="Municipal"></category></entry><entry><title>How cycling is going in the District of North Vancouver</title><link href="https://beyondcars.ca/how-cycling-is-going-in-the-district-of-north-vancouver.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-02-10T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-02-10T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Andy McKay</name></author><id>tag:beyondcars.ca,2023-02-10:/how-cycling-is-going-in-the-district-of-north-vancouver.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The District is talking about removing a bike lane and deferring cycling projects.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The District of North Vancouver is discussing removing the bike lane on &lt;a href="https://www.nsnews.com/local-news/district-of-north-vancouver-29th-bike-lane-6365884"&gt;29th Street&lt;/a&gt;. Unsurprisngly lead by Councilors Lisa Muri, Betty Forbes and Mike Little on removing part of the bike lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current news is that the District will spend $200k to remove or alter the bike lane to provide 8 parking spots. So that's $25k per parking spot to allow storage of private property on public land, reducing access for everyone else. This is a reminder that free parking isn't free and is a choice by municipalities for tax payers to subsidise parking &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking that perhaps this project was put in hastily or without public consultation, this project took over 3 years from public engagement to completion &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so it didn't happen overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time the District is looking at deferring or delaying more bike lanes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/dnv-budget-2023.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes delaying the Spirit Trail. The Spirit Trail is meant to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Winding its way along our scenic waterfront, the North Shore Spirit Trail is truly a City treasure as a fully accessible 35km greenway that will extend from Horseshoe Bay to Deep Cove&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;City of North Vancouver, &lt;a href="https://www.cnv.org/Parks-Recreation/Parks-Greenways/greenways/north-shore-spirit-trail"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City of North Vancouver has done a great job on the Spirit trail and should be lauded for the work they've done. The District of North Vancouver has done nothing and it stops at the City boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means there is no safe way to cycle to Deep Cove, one of Vancouvers most popular tourist locations. A spot that every year is overrun by cars. It's the number one complaint and issue in Deep Cove and repeatedly the District asks people to cycle and then &lt;strong&gt;provides no safe way to do it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spirit Trail has been delayed &lt;strong&gt;since its first proposal in 2007&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summary: the District seems to be going all the wrong directions. If you feel none of this makes sense, feel free to &lt;a href="https://www.dnv.org/government-administration/mayor-and-councillors"&gt;contact the councillors&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or as Eli Mallin put it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I emailed all these candidates recently and only Jordan Back took the time to reply. Since I cycle or walk past Mike Little's house everyday, perhaps I should drop a letter off in person instead.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
