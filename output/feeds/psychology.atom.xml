It's a phenomenon to describe how the unconcious biases have favour cars. &lt;a href="https://thewaroncars.org/2023/01/31/car-brain-with-dr-ian-walker/"&gt;This podcast&lt;/a&gt; gives a good dive into the subject and there's a great &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ianwalker/status/1615248166256869376"&gt;Twitter thread from the author&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something we'll probably revisit multiple times in the future. But let's cover what the survey dove into. They asked 2 groups of people some questions, with just one word changed. The first groups was asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"People shouldn't &lt;code&gt;smoke&lt;/code&gt; in highly populated areas where other people have to breathe the &lt;code&gt;cigarette&lt;/code&gt; fumes"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the second group was asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"People shouldn't &lt;code&gt;drive&lt;/code&gt; in highly populated areas where other people have to breathe the &lt;code&gt;car&lt;/code&gt; fumes"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only change in this case was &lt;code&gt;smoke&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;drive&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cigarette&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;cars&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/cigarettes.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;75%&lt;/strong&gt; of people don't want other people smoking in cities and having to inhale those fumes. Yet for cars the situation is complete reversed with only &lt;strong&gt;17%&lt;/strong&gt; of people having a similar feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many questions in the study, but this is one of biggest disparaties. People won't tolerate second hand smoke, but will tolerate it from cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was repeated on questions about alchohol, working, theft and so on. In each case cars were allowed a free pass. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Risk is a natural part of &lt;code&gt;driving&lt;/code&gt;, and anybody &lt;code&gt;driving&lt;/code&gt; has to accept they could be seriously injured."&lt;/em&gt; vs &lt;em&gt;"Risk is a natural part of &lt;code&gt;working&lt;/code&gt;, and anybody &lt;code&gt;working&lt;/code&gt; has to accept they could be seriously injured"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;61%&lt;/strong&gt; of respondents said they agree with that for driving. For working the number drops &lt;strong&gt;31%&lt;/strong&gt;. We have public institutions and laws to prevent workplace accidents and injuries and have successfully reduced injuries over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows that people aren't using the ethical standards universally. We also saw this during the pandemic when people on social media made comments similar to &lt;em&gt;"As many people die from driving as from COVID, but we don't stop people driving"&lt;/em&gt;. Without thinking that we should stop people from dying when they drive, neither is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driving has become socially acceptable as dangerous to us and the plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Growing up surrounded by that environment, people internalise the idea that fast, untrammelled, near-consequence-free motoring is normal and, moreover, people conclude that this must surely be the proper way of things
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thinking of it being normal they call "Motornormativity".&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Psychology"></category><category term="Infrastructure"></category><category term="Politics"></category><category term="Psychology"></category></entry></feed>
