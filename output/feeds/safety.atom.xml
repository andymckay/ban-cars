Pedestrians, cyclists and other road users are reminded constantly through a barrage of messaging that its our responsibility to "make eye contact", "dress brightly", "wear lights at night" and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's talk about buildings. Y'know those big stationary things that don't move. Do drivers drive into those? Yep all the time. But unfortunately we rarely have statistics on those and they aren't reported. Here's some stories of cars crashing into buildings from a quick internet search:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/car-house.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/man-dies-after-crashing-car-into-vancouver-home-furnishings-storefront-1.5189144"&gt;Man dies after car driver crashes into home furnishings store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-store-hit-by-car-for-10th-time-1.1300835"&gt;Vancouver store hit by car driver for 10th time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/9759695/west-vancouver-whole-foods-crash/"&gt;Driver crashes through produce section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/1-person-critically-injured-after-car-crashes-into-downtown-vancouver-restaurant-1.6555371"&gt;Driver crashes into downtown restaurant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/9981361/vehicle-evades-roadblock-crashes-vancouver-home/"&gt;Driver crashes into Vancouver home, ignites fire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thanks to a &lt;a href="https://6abc.com/7-eleven-lawsuit-car-slamming-into-front-of-stores-chicago-man-injured-in-crash-bensenville-incident/12791366/"&gt;lawsuit in the US&lt;/a&gt; we do have a number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A Chicago area man just received a record-breaking settlement from 7-Eleven after losing both his legs in a pin-in crash at a store back in 2017.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that lawsuit revealed an interesting fact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Over a 15-year period, 6,253 cars crashed into 7-Eleven storefronts in the U.S. - an average of 1.14 per day.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's right more than once a day in the US, a car driver crashes their car into a 7-11. And that's just 7-11's, never mind all the other stores and buildings out there. All those buildings that don't "make eye contact", "dash out into the road" or so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps ICBC should hand out &lt;a href="https://pedestrianreflectors.com/blogs/news/icbc-fall-feather-safety-reflector-campaign"&gt;reflect stickers to those buildings&lt;/a&gt;, I'm sure that will help.&lt;/p&gt;

So this brings up a question, how do you design to stop them?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In British Columbia, trucks have been crashing into bridges regularly. The &lt;a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/bc-trucking-association-calls-on-industry-to-prioritize-safety-following-overpass-crash-1.6418721"&gt;BC Trucking Association&lt;/a&gt; commented recently on this as there have been 17 bridge strikes along BC Highways. Although I haven't found any measure of the costs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In July 2022, the province spent around $1 million to fix a collision on 192 Street
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/bc-trucking-association-calls-on-industry-to-prioritize-safety-following-overpass-crash-1.6418721"&gt;CTVNews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that begs the question, how would you design it so that a truck doesn't crash into bridge. What measures would you take? Signage? Detection? Currently it sounds like they working on considering higher fines, stepper penalties and long suspensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let's take a look at one of the most famous bridges in North America, "the can opener" or "11 foot 8". It's 11 foot 8 high, or 3.556 meters high and it's in the city of Durham, North Carolina. Raising the bridge would mean huge changes to the train tracks above it. Lowering the road would mean huge changes to the sewer system underneath it. You can watch videos of this bridge and the trucks crashing into it on the &lt;a href="https://11foot8.com"&gt;11foot8.com&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The city of Durham has installed ‚Äúlow clearance‚Äù signs on each of the 3 blocks leading up to the trestle... The signage is good, and the vast majority of truck drivers notice the problem and avoid the bridge. Large signs alert driver to the low clearance several blocks before the bridge. Half a block before the trestle, a sensor detects overheight vehicles and triggers an LED blackout warning sign that was installed in May 2016. That same sensor also triggers a red-light phase at the traffic light directly in front of the trestle (installed in March 2016), so the driver has 50 seconds to read the warning sign next to the red traffic light and consider their next move.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://11foot8.com/11foot8-faq/"&gt;11foot8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to highlight that: &lt;b&gt;the driver has 50 seconds to read the warning sign next to the red traffic light&lt;/b&gt; and then drive forward and crash into it. You can see all these things in this still:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/can-opener.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's also the truck blowing through a red light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What struck me with all this, is what measures do you actually have to take to stop people doing something like this? Admittedly the design of the roads and intersections make this one a truly hard one to fix. The nearby side streets make it hard to put a warning barrier further up the road, and perhaps people turning left or right might not see the signs. But I'm sure limiting access to the side streets has been discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d973.6094924169345!2d-78.91004926924423!3d35.999076840006154!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x89ace40db9efab15%3A0xda22fb0f53c7c0c2!2sThe%20can%20opener%20bridge%2C%20201%20S%20Gregson%20St%2C%20Durham%2C%20NC%2027701%2C%20USA!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sca!4v1685491149798!5m2!1sen!2sca" width="600" height="450" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing this back to British Columbia, or any other jurisdiction, what would be enough to stop people going under low bridges? How many warning signs do you need? How many flashing lights and overhead sensors? How many red lights?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the bridge was slightly raised in 2019, by 8 inches it sounds like things have improved from before, but its still happening, more often now with rental trucks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Safety"></category><category term="Enforcement"></category><category term="Safety"></category><category term="Design"></category></entry><entry><title>Traffic lights that stop speeders</title><link href="https://beyondcars.ca/traffic-lights-that-stop-speeders.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-05-11T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-05-11T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Andy McKay</name></author><id>tag:beyondcars.ca,2023-05-11:/traffic-lights-that-stop-speeders.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A smart way to slow down speeding drivers, without too much effort.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At Beyond Cars we are big fan of automated tools to enforce rules and provide safe environments for everyone. The amount of time that law enforcement is limited and the damage done from car drivers is large in terms of injury and death. We have the tools now, let's use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally that's meant things like speed cameras, red light cameras, or &lt;a href="https://beyondcars.ca/average-speed-cameras.html"&gt;average speed cameras&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this one from Quebec is interesting, the traffic light &lt;strong&gt;defaults to red&lt;/strong&gt;. It then monitors the speed as you approach and &lt;a href="https://mass.streetsblog.org/2023/05/05/steal-this-idea-in-quebec-a-new-traffic-light-only-turns-green-for-safe-drivers/"&gt;will only turn green if you are at or below the speed limit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this school zone of 30km/h, drivers were speeding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Before the light was installed, Mayor Assaad said that Rue Stravinski had average vehicle speeds of 40 km/h (25 mph). But in the past week, average speeds have dropped to 29 km/h (18 mph).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://mass.streetsblog.org/2023/05/05/steal-this-idea-in-quebec-a-new-traffic-light-only-turns-green-for-safe-drivers/"&gt;Streetsblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really interesting for a few reasons and we love ‚ù§Ô∏è it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's immediate, not weeks later in the post if it was a fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No information is recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No extra infrastructure, processing or organisation is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's using existing cheap technology that is commonly deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It rewards good behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds fantastic and much more effective than a sign which measures your speed and then shows you a happy or sad face &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It's fun.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What I'm are referring to here is the "passing" lane on roads. In right side drive countries, it's the left side lane and in left side drive countries the right lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen multiple social media posts that go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I find it intimidating driving because cars are always driving close behind me in the left hand lane and flashing their lights, even when I'm driving the speed limit"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually you'll get multiple replies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Move over to the right, it's the law."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggestion is that it's the drivers fault for driving at the speed limit. They are being intimidated by those who want to speed. They'll claim that it's the driver in the left hand lane's fault because they haven't moved over, which the MVA says they should. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(3) A driver of a vehicle in the leftmost lane must exit the lane on the approach of another vehicle in that lane, if it is safe to do so, except when&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(a) overtaking and passing a third vehicle,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(b) allowing traffic to merge,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(c) preparing for a left hand turn at an intersection or into an exit, a private road or a driveway, or&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(d) passing an official vehicle stopped on the side of or on the roadway.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96318_05"&gt;BC Motor Vehicle Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it is safe, drivers in the left hand lane should move over to the right as per the conditions. But it's up to that driver to do so at their discretion, not the driver behind them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know it's not about the law. It's about that driver wanting to go as fast as they want, until they meet another car, repeat the process and so on. There are two things going wrong here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A driver speeding, acting aggressive or being impatient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A driver not moving over to the right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Which is more dangerous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driver staying to the left is not causing a dangerous environment. The situation is created by the driver speeding, because if everyone was driving at the speed limit. It doesn't matter what who's in what lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be backed up by legal responses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One difficulty that I faced was a traffic court justice that told me not to bring fail to keep right tickets into her court unless the driver was traveling less than the posted speed limit. If they were following the limit, she would not convict.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drivesmartbc.ca/lanes/left-lane-blockers"&gt;Drive Smart BC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of accidents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A contributing factor in &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/icbc/viz/QuickStatistics-Contributingfactors/Contributingfactors"&gt;27% of crashes in BC is speed&lt;/a&gt;. Drivers in the left lane is not mentioned as cause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way enforcement is applied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2021 &lt;strong&gt;222,603&lt;/strong&gt; tickets were issued for &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/icbc/viz/Contraventions-2021/2021Speeding"&gt;speeding in BC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2021 &lt;strong&gt;60&lt;/strong&gt; tickets were issued for &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/icbc/viz/Contraventions-2021/2021Contraventions"&gt;using the left most lane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/speeding-vs-left-lane.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speeding is the problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police, the courts and ICBC see that speeding is the problem. These groups are the ones that help people after an accident, they know what's going. And it's the speeders, the ones who are impatient with other drivers who are the problem - not the ones driving at the speed limit. Almost 1/3 of accidents have speeding as contributing factor and the police &lt;strong&gt;ticket 3,710 times more people for speeding than they do for people being in the left hand lane&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these problems is much bigger than the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

It's always a factor.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You will often the phrase in the press "Speed wasn't a factor" after a crash. What they are really saying is that the driver was (given available evidence) &lt;strong&gt;not going excessively beyond the speed limit&lt;/strong&gt;. As it turns out &lt;strong&gt;speed is always a factor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that determine if you will survive collision with an object, simplified they are its: &lt;em&gt;mass&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;velocity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;shape&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll leave &lt;em&gt;shape&lt;/em&gt; out of this for the moment, because that's a different subject. Let's focus on the amount of kinetic energy that impacts an object when it's hit by a vehicle. We'll also ignore reaction times from all parties and other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on mass and velocity the amount of kinetic energy is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kinetic energy = 0.5 * mass * velocity&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass has an effect on kinetic energy, but velocity has a much bigger effect, because it's squared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 10kg weight travelling at 1 km/h has 0.38 Joules of kinetic energy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 1kg weight travelling at 10km/h has 3.8 Joules of kinetic energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 0.016kg bullet travelling at 1,296km/h has 1036.8 Joules of kinetic energy &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullets don't weigh much, but they travel really, really, really fast and kill people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or to put it another way, would you rather get hit by a truck travelling 1km/h or a car travelling 100km/h? The car will kill you, the truck might knock you over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what the speed limit is all that matters is how fast that vehicle is moving when it hits you. Survivability rates drop dramatically for a pedestrian hit by a car as speed increases &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At 30km/h your chance of surviving is 90%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At 40km/h your chance of surviving is 60%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At 50km/h your chance of surviving is 10%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between 30km/h and 50km/h is basically the difference between life and death. &lt;strong&gt;Speed is always a factor&lt;/strong&gt; and it will determine if you survive a collision or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the police or press say "speed was not a factor", what they are really saying is that society, traffic engineers and politicians have already decided that convenience of drivers outweighs your chance of surviving a collision.&lt;/p&gt;
