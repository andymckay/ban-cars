It's fun.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What I'm are referring to here is the "passing" lane on roads. In right side drive countries, it's the left side lane and in left side drive countries the right lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen multiple social media posts that go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I find it intimidating driving because cars are always driving close behind me in the left hand lane and flashing their lights, even when I'm driving the speed limit"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually you'll get multiple replies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Move over to the right, it's the law."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggestion is that it's the drivers fault for driving at the speed limit. They are being intimidated by those who want to speed. They'll claim that it's the driver in the left hand lane's fault because they haven't moved over, which the MVA says they should. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(3) A driver of a vehicle in the leftmost lane must exit the lane on the approach of another vehicle in that lane, if it is safe to do so, except when&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(a) overtaking and passing a third vehicle,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(b) allowing traffic to merge,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(c) preparing for a left hand turn at an intersection or into an exit, a private road or a driveway, or&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(d) passing an official vehicle stopped on the side of or on the roadway.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96318_05"&gt;BC Motor Vehicle Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it is safe, drivers in the left hand lane should move over to the right as per the conditions. But it's up to that driver to do so at their discretion, not the driver behind them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know it's not about the law. It's about that driver wanting to go as fast as they want, until they meet another car, repeat the process and so on. There are two things going wrong here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A driver speeding, acting aggressive or being impatient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A driver not moving over to the right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Which is more dangerous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driver staying to the left is not causing a dangerous environment. The situation is created by the driver speeding, because if everyone was driving at the speed limit. It doesn't matter what who's in what lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be backed up by legal responses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One difficulty that I faced was a traffic court justice that told me not to bring fail to keep right tickets into her court unless the driver was traveling less than the posted speed limit. If they were following the limit, she would not convict.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drivesmartbc.ca/lanes/left-lane-blockers"&gt;Drive Smart BC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of accidents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A contributing factor in &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/icbc/viz/QuickStatistics-Contributingfactors/Contributingfactors"&gt;27% of crashes in BC is caused by speed&lt;/a&gt;. Drivers in the left lane is not mentioned as cause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way enforcement is applied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2021 &lt;strong&gt;222,603&lt;/strong&gt; tickets were issued for &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/icbc/viz/Contraventions-2021/2021Speeding"&gt;speeding in BC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2021 &lt;strong&gt;60&lt;/strong&gt; tickets were issued for &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/icbc/viz/Contraventions-2021/2021Contraventions"&gt;using the left most lane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://beyondcars.ca/images/speeding-vs-left-lane.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speeding is the problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police, the courts and ICBC see that speeding is the problem. These groups are the ones that help people after an accident, they know what's going. And it's the speeders, the ones who are impatient with other drivers who are the problem - not the ones driving at the speed limit. Almost 1/3 of accidents have speeding as contributing factor and the police &lt;strong&gt;ticket 3,710 times more people for speeding than they do for people being in the left hand lane&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these problems is much bigger than the other.&lt;/p&gt;

It's always a factor.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You will often the phrase in the press "Speed wasn't a factor" after a crash. What they are really saying is that the driver was (given available evidence) &lt;strong&gt;not going excessively beyond the speed limit&lt;/strong&gt;. As it turns out &lt;strong&gt;speed is always a factor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that determine if you will survive collision with an object, simplified they are its: &lt;em&gt;mass&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;velocity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;shape&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll leave &lt;em&gt;shape&lt;/em&gt; out of this for the moment, because that's a different subject. Let's focus on the amount of kinetic energy that impacts an object when it's hit by a vehicle. We'll also ignore reaction times from all parties and other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on mass and velocity the amount of kinetic energy is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kinetic energy = 0.5 * mass * velocity&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass has an effect on kinetic energy, but velocity has a much bigger effect, because it's squared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 10kg weight travelling at 1 km/h has 0.38 Joules of kinetic energy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 1kg weight travelling at 10km/h has 3.8 Joules of kinetic energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 0.016kg bullet travelling at 1,296km/h has 1036.8 Joules of kinetic energy &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullets don't weigh much, but they travel really, really, really fast and kill people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or to put it another way, would you rather get hit by a truck travelling 1km/h or a car travelling 100km/h? The car will kill you, the truck might knock you over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what the speed limit is all that matters is how fast that vehicle is moving when it hits you. Survivability rates drop dramatically for a pedestrian hit by a car as speed increases &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At 30km/h your chance of surviving is 90%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At 40km/h your chance of surviving is 60%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At 50km/h your chance of surviving is 10%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between 30km/h and 50km/h is basically the difference between life and death. &lt;strong&gt;Speed is always a factor&lt;/strong&gt; and it will determine if you survive a collision or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the police or press say "speed was not a factor", what they are really saying is that society, traffic engineers and politicians have already decided that convenience of drivers outweighs your chance of surviving a collision.&lt;/p&gt;
