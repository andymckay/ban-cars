As usual the bike lanes are up to us to fight for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One refrain that I've heard from people is "Why would anyone ride a bike on Broadway?". Broadway is a major east - west artery in Vancouver with &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@49.2639041,-123.1535837,3a,75y,256.49h,97.44t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sFW0E8ABJFovX7hkXmA-mGw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192"&gt;many lanes for cars and space&lt;/a&gt; for parking. It's currently gaining rapid transit in the form of &lt;a href="https://www.broadwaysubway.ca/"&gt;the Skytrain&lt;/a&gt; and as a result part of a &lt;a href="https://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/broadway-plan.aspx"&gt;30 year plan to redesign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be surprised that a 30 year plan for a city that has &lt;a href="https://vancouver.ca/green-vancouver/vancouvers-climate-emergency.aspx"&gt;declared a climate emergency&lt;/a&gt; does not involve active transportation as part of its plan, but here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway back to the question "Why would anyone ride a bike on Broadway?". Well for the same reason that anyone would walk or drive a car. &lt;strong&gt;To get to work. To get to school. To get to shops. To get to cafes. To see friends.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y'know all those things that we all do all the time, but bicyclists can't because there's no safe space. People often view cycling as a hobby done for exercise and that's part of the problem, it is way for people to get around - and that's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next question is "Why would anyone ride a bike on Broadway when there's cycle routes just two blocks away?". Well those cycle routes aren't bike lanes, just traffic calmed streets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also they are two blocks away, why can't we slow and divert cars instead of bikes? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, do we ever ask why cars need to drive down Broadway when there's a perfectly good subway line going in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But generally, there are thousands and thousands of kilometers of car dedicated infrastructure in Vancouver and still a ridiculously small amount of space for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Vancouver"></category><category term="Politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Barriers save lives</title><link href="https://beyondcars.ca/barriers-save-lives.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-27T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-03-27T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Andy McKay</name></author><id>tag:beyondcars.ca,2023-03-27:/barriers-save-lives.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Much hilarity in Vancouver this week due to one of our talk radio hosts.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Vancouver has been trying to slow down traffic and has installed some bright yellow concrete blocks to slow cars down. This resulted in this tweet which as of writing has clocked up 6.8M views:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CityofVancouver?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CityofVancouver&lt;/a&gt;‚Å© this is second incident I‚Äôve seen caused by these useless ‚Äòslow street‚Äô barricades installed last month.

&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The replies and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jillreports/status/1639037832386998272/retweets/with_comments"&gt;quotes&lt;/a&gt; were worth it. Because as many people pointed out, it has &lt;em&gt;really slowed down that SUV&lt;/em&gt;. If you can't see that bright yellow concrete barrier and drive into it fast enough to end up like that... something is wrong and we need to slow you down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after it got a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gappleca/status/1639379807401299969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1639379807401299969%7Ctwgr%5Ed335216f092df90fa83fa12672b607c8ec4ceb80%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2Fgappleca2Fstatus2F1639379807401299969widget%3DTweet"&gt;sticker from the great podcast &lt;a href="https://thewaroncars.org/"&gt;The War on Cars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least it was painted in bright high visibility paint... &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HiVisFails"&gt;oh wait&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CKNW is a local talk radio station and it's hosts have also been stoking the anti bike lane rhetoric in Stanley Park. It might be that their only listeners are car drivers and they just talking to their audience?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Vancouver"></category><category term="Politics"></category></entry><entry><title>What barrier placement shows you</title><link href="https://beyondcars.ca/what-barrier-placement-shows-you.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-02-28T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-02-28T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Andy McKay</name></author><id>tag:beyondcars.ca,2023-02-28:/what-barrier-placement-shows-you.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If barriers are needed to protect car drivers from themselves, why aren't they needed to protect everyone else from car drivers?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You see them regularly on the side of roads, movable concrete barriers &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on the side of the road. Safety barriers like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;used to stop 'out of control' vehicles from leaving the road and hitting roadside hazards, including slopes&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;IRAP, &lt;a href="https://toolkit.irap.org/safer-road-treatments/roadside-safety-barriers/"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so 'out of control' or 'errant' vehicles are a problem. When you drive the Sea to Sky highway you might be grateful that there's some barriers to protect you from going over the edge, or into a cliff üëá&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/sea-to-sky.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Car drivers make mistakes and the damage caused in those mistakes need mitigating by the addition of barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But look at that image again and you'll notice between the car lanes and barriers is the bike lane. The bike lane is protected with a peice of paint, it doesn't get a barrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pattern you see all over the place. On causeway to the ferry terminal at Tsawwassen üëá&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/ferry-causeway.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the low level road in North Vancouver üëá&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/low-level-road.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The barriers in this case are protecting cars from going into bushes, slopes or onto beaches. This is a clear admission that things can go wrong and is done to protect car drivers from the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the most vulnerable road users are not protected in any manner from the exact same circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The barrier is an admisssion that the car driver is not too be trusted to drive in a safe and careful manner down the road. While simultaneously ignoring the exact same situation for cyclists.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that needs to happen is to move the &lt;em&gt;movable barrier&lt;/em&gt; to the left and provide a seperation between the car lane and bike lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see a barrier placement like this, ask yourself what the politicians and traffic engineers who designed and approved this were thinking of and who they care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all barriers are the same, but the most common is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_barrier"&gt;Jersey barriers&lt;/a&gt;, first used in New Jersey in 1950s and have a &lt;a href="https://highways.dot.gov/public-roads/marchapril-2000/basics-concrete-barriers"&gt;particular geometry&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's the advocacy that is.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Park"&gt;Stanley Park&lt;/a&gt; is a often regarded as a jewel in Vancouver's park system. A huge park next to downtown and accessible from all over Vancouver the 405 hectare public park is a great place for so many activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the COVID lockdown in 2020, people needed to get out, but stay social distanced. There is a seawall that runs around the outside of the park and also a roadway. As we all found during the pandemic, the seawall is not wide enough to allow for social distancing, so the park board took up most of one lane of the road for a bike lane. This gave pedestrians more space, cyclists more space and gave people space to enjoy the park during the lock down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2023 and every few months its still being discussed if this bike lane should be permanent. As park boards come and go, new ideas come up, we keep getting asked if we want a bike lane, we all keep e-mailing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radio talk show hosts and others keeping stoking controversy and spreading misleading facts about the park not being accessible. The drums keep beating for more cars because "access" is equated to having a car at the exclusion of all other access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2023, the Park board has voted to remove all but a few bits of the park to motorists. They are spending another $330,000 of taxpayers money to remove the bike lane (which has cost money to put in as well). They are planning a new version of the bike lane which is two lanes for motorists and another seperated bike lane at between $20 and $50 million &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and will take around 10 years to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocating for a solution like that is just disingenguous. &lt;em&gt;It is an excuse to never build anything, claim it's too expensive, repeatedly defer and then eventually drop the project in the future.&lt;/em&gt; A similar excercise is happening with the &lt;a href="https://beyondcars.ca/how-cycling-is-going-in-the-district-of-north-vancouver.html"&gt;Spirit Trail in North Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a good summary of the bike lane and all the details and how it still allows the park to be accessible, check out &lt;a href="https://lovethelane.ca/"&gt;Love the Lane&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I've learned a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is exhausting to keep advocating for this bike lane. We are continually asked our opinion, continually sending emails and just being ignored. Repeatedly. The park board ignored the 411 of 594 emails supporting a different approach and went with the politically motivated one. This has been going on for over &lt;strong&gt;two years&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever put in a road, it is &lt;strong&gt;almost impossible to get it out&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bike lanes and infrastructure are given a fraction of the funding yet receive a level of planning, inspection, public consultation and so on than any other development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheap and simple options are often ignored in favour of expensive, complicated solutions. See also the &lt;a href="https://beyondcars.ca/how-cycling-is-going-in-the-district-of-north-vancouver.html"&gt;District of North Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; where we are spending $200,000 to create 8 parking spots out of a bike lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can't get people to accept that &lt;strong&gt;a park&lt;/strong&gt; should not have a &lt;strong&gt;two lane&lt;/strong&gt; road going through it, then what hope do we have for the rest of our city? What hope do we have to combat climate change and car culture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some amazing people who are able to give thoughtful and meaningful arguments and keep advocating for the park. People such as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/martynschmoll"&gt;Martyn Schmoll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://mastodon.social/@Lucyincanada@c.im"&gt;Lucy in Canada&lt;/a&gt; just keep going. Thank you to you all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cycling isn't the exhausting thing, advocating for it is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen estimates on Twitter go up to $100 million, which given inflation between now and 10 years time, seems an underestimate.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
